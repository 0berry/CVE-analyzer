# CVE analyzer

This project aims to extract from a collection of vulnerabilities report expressed in common English language the following semantic information:

- **Identifying terms**: the name and version of the vulnerable program
- **Capability terms**: the vulnerability class, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) number, and various descriptive terms relating to attacker capability upon exploitation of the vulnerability
- **Trigger terms**: symbols names and binary addresses

## Dataset

The dataset on which this project will be developed and tested on is the list of Common Vulnerability Exposure (CVE) regarding the Linux kernel for the years 2017 and 2018 (for this first implementation). The dataset can be found on the website [CVE detail](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/47/Linux-Linux-Kernel.html?vendor_id=33)

The dataset is formatted as a Comma Separated Values (CSV) but it has been simplified from it's original version and some of the fields were removed because not important for the purpose of this project.

- **CVE ID**: Unique identifier for the CVE. It might be useful to enrich the database description from other sources.
- **CWE ID**: Common Weakness Enumeration Id. It's an Id which uniquely identify the problem exploited to trigger the vulnerability described. This field is very useful to have a semantic insight on the description.
- **Vulnerability Type(s)**: Family of the vulnerability (I.e. DDos, Buffer overflow, etc.). As in the case of the CWE also this field serves has a precious semantic insight for the description.
- **Avail.**: Description of the vulnerability in common English. Here is where the project should be able to extract semantic components.

## System details

The first step of the project is to perform a Part Of Speech (POS) tagging on the descriptions of the CVEs in order to have a syntactic overview of the sentences. This first task will be done using a python library for NLP called SpaCy \cite{spacy}.
After having a syntactic overview of a description, those sentences will be organized in a parse tree and I will try to figure out peculiar structural properties in order to identify useful semantic information (i.e. function names, kernel version, etc.).

## Testing

The results produced by the tool will be tested against a ground truth of manually annotated CVE descriptions and the accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure will be extracted by this testing phase.
The metrics employed to calculate this performances will be the number of semantic features extracted from the description and how accurate are them compared to the ground truth.y

## Installation

The project require the spacy large dataset to work. To download it run the followiing command:
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```
