None	** DISPUTED ** Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824 already. The problem has limited scope, as users don't usually have permissions to access SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*` to make the devices accessible. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this report, noting that the requirement for an attacker to have both the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities makes it "virtually impossible to exploit."
Complete	The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).
Complete	The Linux Kernel version 3.18 contains a dangerous feature vulnerability in modify_user_hw_breakpoint() that can result in crash and possibly memory corruption. This attack appear to be exploitable via local code execution and the ability to use ptrace. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in git commit f67b15037a7a50c57f72e69a6d59941ad90a0f0f.

Complete	Linux Linux kernel version at least v4.8 onwards, probably well before contains a Insufficient input validation vulnerability in bnx2x network card driver that can result in DoS: Network card firmware assertion takes card off-line. This attack appear to be exploitable via An attacker on a must pass a very large, specially crafted packet to the bnx2x card. This can be done from an untrusted guest VM..
Complete	In the Linux kernel 4.12, 3.10, 2.6 and possibly earlier versions a race condition vulnerability exists in the sound system, this can lead to a deadlock and denial of service condition.
None	arch/x86/kernel/paravirt.c in the Linux kernel before 4.18.1 mishandles certain indirect calls, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct Spectre-v2 attacks against paravirtual guests.
Complete	drivers/infiniband/core/ucma.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11 allows ucma_leave_multicast to access a certain data structure after a cleanup step in ucma_process_join, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free).
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11, as used in Xen through 4.11.x. The xen_failsafe_callback entry point in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S does not properly maintain RBX, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory usage and system crash). Within Xen, 64-bit x86 PV Linux guest OS users can trigger a guest OS crash or possibly gain privileges.
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in hfsplus_lookup() in fs/hfsplus/dir.c when opening a file (that is purportedly a hard link) in an hfs+ filesystem that has malformed catalog data, and is mounted read-only without a metadata directory.

Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an invalid pointer dereference in io_ctl_map_page() when mounting and operating a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of block group item validation in check_leaf_item in fs/btrfs/tree-checker.c.
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an invalid pointer dereference in btrfs_root_node() when mounting a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of chunk block group mapping validation in btrfs_read_block_groups in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c, and a lack of empty-tree checks in check_leaf in fs/btrfs/tree-checker.c.
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is a use-after-free in try_merge_free_space() when mounting a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of chunk type flag checks in btrfs_check_chunk_valid in fs/btrfs/volumes.c.
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is out-of-bounds access in write_extent_buffer() when mounting and operating a crafted btrfs image, because of a lack of verification that each block group has a corresponding chunk at mount time, within btrfs_read_block_groups in fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c.
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.10. There is an invalid pointer dereference in __del_reloc_root() in fs/btrfs/relocation.c when mounting a crafted btrfs image, related to removing reloc rb_trees when reloc control has not been initialized.
Complete	An integer overflow in the uvesafb_setcmap function in drivers/video/fbdev/uvesafb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.4 could result in local attackers being able to crash the kernel or potentially elevate privileges because kmalloc_array is not used.
Partial	The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.4 allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership, in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the non-member can trigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. The intended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of a directory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. The non-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable and SGID.
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3, which does not properly validate secs_per_zone in a corrupted f2fs image, as demonstrated by a divide-by-zero error.
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/inline.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and BUG) can occur for a modified f2fs filesystem image in which an inline inode contains an invalid reserved blkaddr.
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (slab out-of-bounds read and BUG) can occur for a modified f2fs filesystem image in which FI_EXTRA_ATTR is set in an inode.
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is an out-of-bounds read or a divide-by-zero error for an incorrect user_block_count in a corrupted f2fs image, leading to a denial of service (BUG).
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and BUG) can occur upon encountering an abnormal bitmap size when mounting a crafted f2fs image.
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_inode_buf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. A denial of service (memory corruption and BUG) can occur for a corrupted xfs image upon encountering an inode that is in extent format, but has more extents than fit in the inode fork.
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr_leaf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An OOPS may occur for a corrupted xfs image after xfs_da_shrink_inode() is called with a NULL bp.
Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during allocation.
Partial	The alarm_timer_nsleep function in kernel/time/alarmtimer.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3 has an integer overflow via a large relative timeout because ktime_add_safe is not used.
Complete	ntfs_attr_find in the ntfs.ko filesystem driver in the Linux kernel 4.15.0 allows attackers to trigger a stack-based out-of-bounds write and cause a denial of service (kernel oops or panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ntfs filesystem.
Complete	ntfs_end_buffer_async_read in the ntfs.ko filesystem driver in the Linux kernel 4.15.0 allows attackers to trigger a stack-based out-of-bounds write and cause a denial of service (kernel oops or panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ntfs filesystem.

Complete	In the Linux kernel 4.15.0, a NULL pointer dereference was discovered in hfs_ext_read_extent in hfs.ko. This can occur during a mount of a crafted hfs filesystem.
Partial	In arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.2, when nested virtualization is used, local attackers could cause L1 KVM guests to VMEXIT, potentially allowing privilege escalations and denial of service attacks due to lack of checking of CPL.
Partial	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An Integer Overflow in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the POSIX timer code is caused by the way the overrun accounting works. Depending on interval and expiry time values, the overrun can be larger than INT_MAX, but the accounting is int based. This basically makes the accounting values, which are visible to user space via timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun, random. For example, a local user can cause a denial of service (signed integer overflow) via crafted mmap, futex, timer_create, and timer_settime system calls.
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. The filter parsing in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c could be called with no filter, which is an N=0 case when it expected at least one line to have been read, thus making the N-1 index invalid. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted perf_event_open and mmap system calls.
Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. vbg_misc_device_ioctl() in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads the same user data twice with copy_from_user. The header part of the user data is double-fetched, and a malicious user thread can tamper with the critical variables (hdr.size_in and hdr.size_out) in the header between the two fetches because of a race condition, leading to severe kernel errors, such as buffer over-accesses. This bug can cause a local denial of service and information leakage.
Partial	In the ea_get function in fs/jfs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, a memory corruption bug in JFS can be triggered by calling setxattr twice with two different extended attribute names on the same file. This vulnerability can be triggered by an unprivileged user with the ability to create files and execute programs. A kmalloc call is incorrect, leading to slab-out-of-bounds in jfs_xattr.
Complete	In net/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, there is a race condition between fchownat and close in cases where they target the same socket file descriptor, related to the sock_close and sockfs_setattr functions. fchownat does not increment the file descriptor reference count, which allows close to set the socket to NULL during fchownat's execution, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
None	The compat_get_timex function in kernel/compat.c in the Linux kernel before 4.16.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via adjtimex.
Complete	The sr_do_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.12 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact because sense buffers have different sizes at the CDROM layer and the SCSI layer, as demonstrated by a CDROMREADMODE2 ioctl call.
Partial	In the Linux kernel 4.13 through 4.16.11, ext4_read_inline_data() in fs/ext4/inline.c performs a memcpy with an untrusted length value in certain circumstances involving a crafted filesystem that stores the system.data extended attribute value in a dedicated inode.
Complete	The etm_setup_aux function in drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-etm-perf.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because a parameter is incorrectly used as a local variable.
Complete	The cdrom_ioctl_media_changed function in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c in the Linux kernel before 4.16.6 allows local attackers to use a incorrect bounds check in the CDROM driver CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl to read out kernel memory.
Complete	A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker can use this to escalate their privileges.
Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bounds write in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata(), a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bound write in in fs/jbd2/transaction.c code, a denial of service, and a system crash by unmounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bound access in ext4_get_group_info function, a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
Complete	Linux kernel is vulnerable to a stack-out-of-bounds write in the ext4 filesystem code when mounting and writing to a crafted ext4 image in ext4_update_inline_data(). An attacker could use this to cause a system crash and a denial of service.
Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause a use-after-free in ext4_xattr_set_entry function and a denial of service or unspecified other impact may occur by renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.

Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause a use-after-free in ext4_xattr_set_entry function and a denial of service or unspecified other impact may occur by renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
Complete	The Linux kernel before version 4.11 is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in fs/cifs/cifsencrypt.c:setup_ntlmv2_rsp() that allows an attacker controlling a CIFS server to kernel panic a client that has this server mounted, because an empty TargetInfo field in an NTLMSSP setup negotiation response is mishandled during session recovery.
Complete	The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.15.7 mishandles the case of a rule blob that contains a jump but lacks a user-defined chain, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by leveraging the CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, related to arpt_do_table in net/ipv4/netfilter/arp_tables.c, ipt_do_table in net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c, and ip6t_do_table in net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6_tables.c.
None	The timer_create syscall implementation in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.8 doesn't properly validate the sigevent->sigev_notify field, which leads to out-of-bounds access in the show_timer function (called when /proc/$PID/timers is read). This allows userspace applications to read arbitrary kernel memory (on a kernel built with CONFIG_POSIX_TIMERS and CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE).
Partial	In the Linux kernel before 4.13.5, a local user could create keyrings for other users via keyctl commands, setting unwanted defaults or causing a denial of service.
Complete	The arch_timer_reg_read_stable macro in arch/arm64/include/asm/arch_timer.h in the Linux kernel before 4.13 allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion) by writing to a file under /sys/kernel/debug in certain circumstances, as demonstrated by a scenario involving debugfs, ftrace, PREEMPT_TRACER, and FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER.
Complete	The __get_data_block function in fs/f2fs/data.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and loop) via crafted use of the open and fallocate system calls with an FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl.
Partial	The perf_cpu_time_max_percent_handler function in kernel/events/core.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large value, as demonstrated by an incorrect sample-rate calculation.
Partial	The add_free_nid function in fs/f2fs/node.c in the Linux kernel before 4.12 does not properly track an allocated nid, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (race condition) or possibly have unspecified other impact via concurrent threads.
Complete	fs/f2fs/segment.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) by using a noflush_merge option that triggers a NULL value for a flush_cmd_control data structure.
Partial	The Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.15.9 mishandles a mutex within libsas, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) by triggering certain error-handling code.
Partial	In the Linux kernel before 4.15, fs/ocfs2/aops.c omits use of a semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG) by modifying a certain e_cpos field.
Partial	In the Linux kernel before 4.12, Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) does not consider the ETH_SS_PRIV_FLAGS case when retrieving sset_count data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by incompatibility between hns_get_sset_count and ethtool_get_strings.
Complete	The __munlock_pagevec function in mm/mlock.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NR_MLOCK accounting corruption) via crafted use of mlockall and munlockall system calls.
Complete	In drivers/net/ethernet/hisilicon/hns/hns_enet.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13, local users can cause a denial of service (use-after-free and BUG) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging differences in skb handling between hns_nic_net_xmit_hw and hns_nic_net_xmit.
Partial	In fs/ocfs2/cluster/nodemanager.c in the Linux kernel before 4.15, local users can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and BUG) because a required mutex is not used.
Complete	The madvise_willneed function in mm/madvise.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by triggering use of MADVISE_WILLNEED for a DAX mapping.
Partial	The ocfs2_setattr function in fs/ocfs2/file.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via DIO requests.
Partial	The dm_get_from_kobject function in drivers/md/dm.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.3 allow local users to cause a denial of service (BUG) by leveraging a race condition with __dm_destroy during creation and removal of DM devices.
Complete	The __oom_reap_task_mm function in mm/oom_kill.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.4 mishandles gather operations, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (TLB entry leak or use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a copy_to_user call within a certain time window.
Complete	The f2fs implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.14 mishandles reference counts associated with f2fs_wait_discard_bios calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG), as demonstrated by fstrim.
Complete	fs/f2fs/extent_cache.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13 mishandles extent trees, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG) via an application with multiple threads.
Partial	In the Linux kernel before 4.7, the amd_gpio_remove function in drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-amd.c calls the pinctrl_unregister function, leading to a double free.
Complete	drivers/input/serio/i8042.c in the Linux kernel before 4.12.4 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because the port->exists value can change after it is validated.
Complete	crypto/pcrypt.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.13 mishandles freeing instances, allowing a local user able to access the AF_ALG-based AEAD interface (CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_AEAD) and pcrypt (CONFIG_CRYPTO_PCRYPT) to cause a denial of service (kfree of an incorrect pointer) or possibly have unspecified other impact by executing a crafted sequence of system calls.
Complete	The tcpmss_mangle_packet function in net/netfilter/xt_TCPMSS.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11, and 4.9.x before 4.9.36, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the presence of xt_TCPMSS in an iptables action.
Complete	The "stub_send_ret_submit()" function (drivers/usb/usbip/stub_tx.c) in the Linux Kernel before version 4.14.8, 4.9.71, 4.1.49, and 4.4.107 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a specially crafted USB over IP packet.

None	The vhci_hcd driver in the Linux Kernel before version 4.14.8 and 4.4.114 allows allows local attackers to disclose kernel memory addresses. Successful exploitation requires that a USB device is attached over IP.
Complete	A use-after-free vulnerability was found in network namespaces code affecting the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. The function get_net_ns_by_id() in net/core/net_namespace.c does not check for the net::count value after it has found a peer network in netns_ids idr, which could lead to double free and memory corruption. This vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local user to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is thought to be unlikely.
Complete	A flaw was found in the hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte function in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.12. A lack of size check could cause a denial of service (BUG).
Complete	A flaw was found in the hugetlb_mcopy_atomic_pte function in mm/hugetlb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13. A superfluous implicit page unlock for VM_SHARED hugetlbfs mapping could trigger a local denial of service (BUG).
Complete	A use-after-free flaw was found in fs/userfaultfd.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.6. The issue is related to the handling of fork failure when dealing with event messages. Failure to fork correctly can lead to a situation where a fork event will be removed from an already freed list of events with userfaultfd_ctx_put().
None	A kernel data leak due to an out-of-bound read was found in the Linux kernel in inet_diag_msg_sctp{,l}addr_fill() and sctp_get_sctp_info() functions present since version 4.7-rc1 through version 4.13. A data leak happens when these functions fill in sockaddr data structures used to export socket's diagnostic information. As a result, up to 100 bytes of the slab data could be leaked to a userspace.
Partial	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before version 4.12 in the way the KVM module processed the trap flag(TF) bit in EFLAGS during emulation of the syscall instruction, which leads to a debug exception(#DB) being raised in the guest stack. A user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges inside the guest. Linux guests are not affected by this.
Complete	In the Linux kernel before version 4.12, Kerberos 5 tickets decoded when using the RXRPC keys incorrectly assumes the size of a field. This could lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going over the end of the buffer. This could possibly lead to memory corruption and possible privilege escalation.
Complete	It was found that the Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation before 2.6.22.17 used the IPv4-only inet_sk_rebuild_header() function for both IPv4 and IPv6 DCCP connections, which could result in memory corruptions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.
Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of clearing SELinux attributes on /proc/pid/attr files before 4.9.10. An empty (null) write to this file can crash the system by causing the system to attempt to access unmapped kernel memory.
Complete	** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. Since the page allocator does not yield CPU resources to the owner of the oom_lock mutex, a local unprivileged user can trivially lock up the system forever by wasting CPU resources from the page allocator (e.g., via concurrent page fault events) when the global OOM killer is invoked. NOTE: the software maintainer has not accepted certain proposed patches, in part because of a viewpoint that "the underlying problem is non-trivial to handle."
None	It was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.11-rc8 that root can gain direct access to an internal keyring, such as '.dns_resolver' in RHEL-7 or '.builtin_trusted_keys' upstream, by joining it as its session keyring. This allows root to bypass module signature verification by adding a new public key of its own devising to the keyring.
Complete	The memory resource controller (aka memcg) in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) by spawning new processes within a memory-constrained cgroup.
