1;CVE-2018-1000204;264;;;2018-06-26;2018-08-29;6.3;None;Remote;Medium;Single system;Complete;None;None	** DISPUTED ** Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824 already. The problem has limited scope, as users don't usually have permissions to access SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*` to make the devices accessible. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this report, noting that the requirement for an attacker to have both the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities makes it "virtually impossible to exploit."
2;CVE-2018-1000200;476;;;2018-06-05;2018-08-29;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).

20;CVE-2018-13405;264;;;2018-07-06;2018-08-29;4.6;None;Local;Low;Not required;Partial;Partial;Partial	The inode_init_owner function in fs/inode.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.4 allows local users to create files with an unintended group ownership, in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of that group. Here, the non-member can trigger creation of a plain file whose group ownership is that group. The intended behavior was that the non-member can trigger creation of a directory (but not a plain file) whose group ownership is that group. The non-member can escalate privileges by making the plain file executable and SGID.
21;CVE-2018-13100;369;;;2018-07-03;2018-08-23;4.3;None;Remote;Medium;Not required;None;None;Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/f2fs/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3, which does not properly validate secs_per_zone in a corrupted f2fs image, as demonstrated by a divide-by-zero error.

27;CVE-2018-13094;476;;;2018-07-03;2018-08-29;4.3;None;Remote;Medium;Not required;None;None;Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/libxfs/xfs_attr_leaf.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An OOPS may occur for a corrupted xfs image after xfs_da_shrink_inode() is called with a NULL bp.
28;CVE-2018-13093;476;;;2018-07-03;2018-08-23;4.3;None;Remote;Medium;Not required;None;None;Partial	An issue was discovered in fs/xfs/xfs_icache.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. There is a NULL pointer dereference and panic in lookup_slow() on a NULL inode->i_ops pointer when doing pathwalks on a corrupted xfs image. This occurs because of a lack of proper validation that cached inodes are free during allocation.
29;CVE-2018-13053;190;;Overflow;2018-07-02;2018-08-30;4.6;None;Local;Low;Not required;Partial;Partial;Partial	The alarm_timer_nsleep function in kernel/time/alarmtimer.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3 has an integer overflow via a large relative timeout because ktime_add_safe is not used.

31;CVE-2018-12930;787;;DoS;2018-06-28;2018-08-21;7.2;None;Local;Low;Not required;Complete;Complete;Complete	ntfs_end_buffer_async_read in the ntfs.ko filesystem driver in the Linux kernel 4.15.0 allows attackers to trigger a stack-based out-of-bounds write and cause a denial of service (kernel oops or panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ntfs filesystem.
32;CVE-2018-12929;416;;DoS;2018-06-28;2018-08-21;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	ntfs_read_locked_inode in the ntfs.ko filesystem driver in the Linux kernel 4.15.0 allows attackers to trigger a use-after-free read and possibly cause a denial of service (kernel oops or panic) via a crafted ntfs filesystem.
33;CVE-2018-12928;476;;;2018-06-28;2018-08-21;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	In the Linux kernel 4.15.0, a NULL pointer dereference was discovered in hfs_ext_read_extent in hfs.ko. This can occur during a mount of a crafted hfs filesystem.
34;CVE-2018-12904;264;;DoS;2018-06-27;2018-08-29;4.4;None;Local;Medium;Not required;Partial;Partial;Partial	In arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.2, when nested virtualization is used, local attackers could cause L1 KVM guests to VMEXIT, potentially allowing privilege escalations and denial of service attacks due to lack of checking of CPL.
35;CVE-2018-12896;190;;DoS Overflow;2018-07-02;2018-09-04;2.1;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Partial	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.3. An Integer Overflow in kernel/time/posix-timers.c in the POSIX timer code is caused by the way the overrun accounting works. Depending on interval and expiry time values, the overrun can be larger than INT_MAX, but the accounting is int based. This basically makes the accounting values, which are visible to user space via timer_getoverrun(2) and siginfo::si_overrun, random. For example, a local user can cause a denial of service (signed integer overflow) via crafted mmap, futex, timer_create, and timer_settime system calls.
36;CVE-2018-12714;787;;DoS;2018-06-24;2018-08-21;10.0;None;Remote;Low;Not required;Complete;Complete;Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. The filter parsing in kernel/trace/trace_events_filter.c could be called with no filter, which is an N=0 case when it expected at least one line to have been read, thus making the N-1 index invalid. This allows attackers to cause a denial of service (slab out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted perf_event_open and mmap system calls.
37;CVE-2018-12633;362;;DoS +Info;2018-06-21;2018-08-21;6.3;None;Local;Medium;Not required;Complete;None;Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.2. vbg_misc_device_ioctl() in drivers/virt/vboxguest/vboxguest_linux.c reads the same user data twice with copy_from_user. The header part of the user data is double-fetched, and a malicious user thread can tamper with the critical variables (hdr.size_in and hdr.size_out) in the header between the two fetches because of a race condition, leading to severe kernel errors, such as buffer over-accesses. This bug can cause a local denial of service and information leakage.
38;CVE-2018-12233;119;;Overflow Mem. Corr.;2018-06-12;2018-08-29;6.8;None;Remote;Medium;Not required;Partial;Partial;Partial	In the ea_get function in fs/jfs/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, a memory corruption bug in JFS can be triggered by calling setxattr twice with two different extended attribute names on the same file. This vulnerability can be triggered by an unprivileged user with the ability to create files and execute programs. A kmalloc call is incorrect, leading to slab-out-of-bounds in jfs_xattr.
39;CVE-2018-12232;362;;;2018-06-12;2018-08-29;7.1;None;Remote;Medium;Not required;None;None;Complete	In net/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, there is a race condition between fchownat and close in cases where they target the same socket file descriptor, related to the sock_close and sockfs_setattr functions. fchownat does not increment the file descriptor reference count, which allows close to set the socket to NULL during fchownat's execution, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash.
40;CVE-2018-11508;200;;+Info;2018-05-28;2018-07-03;2.1;None;Local;Low;Not required;Partial;None;None	The compat_get_timex function in kernel/compat.c in the Linux kernel before 4.16.9 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via adjtimex.
41;CVE-2018-11506;119;;DoS Overflow;2018-05-28;2018-08-29;7.2;None;Local;Low;Not required;Complete;Complete;Complete	The sr_do_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.12 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact because sense buffers have different sizes at the CDROM layer and the SCSI layer, as demonstrated by a CDROMREADMODE2 ioctl call.
42;CVE-2018-11412;416;;;2018-05-24;2018-08-29;4.3;None;Remote;Medium;Not required;None;None;Partial	In the Linux kernel 4.13 through 4.16.11, ext4_read_inline_data() in fs/ext4/inline.c performs a memcpy with an untrusted length value in certain circumstances involving a crafted filesystem that stores the system.data extended attribute value in a dedicated inode.
43;CVE-2018-11232;20;;DoS;2018-05-18;2018-06-19;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	The etm_setup_aux function in drivers/hwtracing/coresight/coresight-etm-perf.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) because a parameter is incorrectly used as a local variable.
44;CVE-2018-10940;119;;Overflow;2018-05-09;2018-08-24;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	The cdrom_ioctl_media_changed function in drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c in the Linux kernel before 4.16.6 allows local attackers to use a incorrect bounds check in the CDROM driver CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl to read out kernel memory.
45;CVE-2018-10901;264;;;2018-07-26;2018-10-02;7.2;None;Local;Low;Not required;Complete;Complete;Complete	A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker can use this to escalate their privileges.
46;CVE-2018-10883;787;;DoS;2018-07-30;2018-10-03;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause an out-of-bounds write in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata(), a denial of service, and a system crash by mounting and operating on a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
47;CVE-2018-10882;787;;DoS;2018-07-27;2018-09-20;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem.

49;CVE-2018-10880;787;;DoS;2018-07-25;2018-09-20;7.1;None;Remote;Medium;Not required;None;None;Complete	Linux kernel is vulnerable to a stack-out-of-bounds write in the ext4 filesystem code when mounting and writing to a crafted ext4 image in ext4_update_inline_data(). An attacker could use this to cause a system crash and a denial of service.
50;CVE-2018-10879;416;;DoS;2018-07-26;2018-09-21;6.1;None;Local;Low;Not required;Partial;Partial;Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem. A local user can cause a use-after-free in ext4_xattr_set_entry function and a denial of service or unspecified other impact may occur by renaming a file in a crafted ext4 filesystem image.
1;CVE-2018-1000204;264;;;2018-06-26;2018-08-29;6.3;None;Remote;Medium;Single system;Complete;None;None	** DISPUTED ** Linux Kernel version 3.18 to 4.16 incorrectly handles an SG_IO ioctl on /dev/sg0 with dxfer_direction=SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV and an empty 6-byte cmdp. This may lead to copying up to 1000 kernel heap pages to the userspace. This has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/a45b599ad808c3c982fdcdc12b0b8611c2f92824 already. The problem has limited scope, as users don't usually have permissions to access SCSI devices. On the other hand, e.g. the Nero user manual suggests doing `chmod o+r+w /dev/sg*` to make the devices accessible. NOTE: third parties dispute the relevance of this report, noting that the requirement for an attacker to have both the CAP_SYS_ADMIN and CAP_SYS_RAWIO capabilities makes it "virtually impossible to exploit."
2;CVE-2018-1000200;476;;;2018-06-05;2018-08-29;4.9;None;Local;Low;Not required;None;None;Complete	The Linux Kernel versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's final thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share the memory and are mlocked).
